# Yorkshire Industry Employment Analysis 

## Project Overview
This project looks at employment trends across industries in Yorkshire and the Humber from 2015 to 2024. I explored:

- How employment has changed across different industries over time
- The impact of COVID-19 (2019–2021) on jobs
- Predicted employment levels in 2030 using regression-based forecasting

The goal was to highlight industry growth, resilience and potential shifts in the regional labour market.

## Repository Contents
- **R Code**: `intro_ds_code.R` - scripts for data cleaning, processing, analysing and visualising the data
- **Dataset**: `bres_yorkshire_industry.xlsx` - annual employment data by industry
- **Plots**: Folder with all the visualisations used in the report (trends, COVID-19 impact, 2030 projections)

## Visualisations
The plots used include:
- Employment trends by industry (2015-2024)
- Top 5 industries by total employment
- Percentage growth by industry
- COVID-19 impact on employment
- Predicted employment growth to 2030
- Pie chart showing predicted employment distribution in 2030

## How to Run
1. Open `intro_ds_code.R` in RStudio (or another R environment).
2. Make sure the dataset (`bres_yorkshire_industry.xlsx`) is in the same folder.
3. Run the scripts to reproduce the analysis and generate all the plots.
